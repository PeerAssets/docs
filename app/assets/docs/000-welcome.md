# PeerAssets documentation

# Introduction

Welcome to PeerAssets, a blockchain agnostic protocol which enables peers to issue, transact, burn, and vote with tokens.
You can use our API, papi.peercoin.net, or host your own. These allow you to access PeerAssets API endpoints, which contains information pertaining to PeerAssets Decks, Cards, and Votes. PeerAssets is inspired by the original idea of "Colored Coins" and uses OP_RETURN to write data on the blockchain, but offers some optimizations to reduce the amount of data written in OP_RETURN. PeerAssets enables easy querying of the blockchain for relevant transactions and offers some extra features like shareholder voting, dividends payouts, and more! To read more about PeerAssets and its functionality check out the [Whitepaper](https://peerassets.github.io/WhitePaper/).
